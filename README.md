# Dash-App-For-Telco-Customer-Churn-Data

This project is about building a dashboard, utilizing the python library of Dash by Plotly for visualizing the exploratory data analysis of the Telco Customer Churn data. 
(Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

In general, the data types which can be displayed by this dashboard are divided into four main categories, including:
1. Categorical Data
2. Numerical Data
3. Categorical Vs Numerical Data
4. Numerical Vs Numerical Data

The users can utilize the dropdown menu to select the data type and its variables which they want to show.

This dashboard utilizes several Python libraries, including:
1. dash
2. dash-bootstrap-components
3. plotly
4. pandas
5. numpy, and
6. regex

By taking advantage of dash-bootstrap-components, the design of the dashboard is responsive to the changes of the screen size.
